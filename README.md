# charisma
A presentation about charisma

This presenation is heavily based on the 'Charisma  Myth' book by Olivia Fox Cabane
It is written in Hebrew and meant for Hebrew speakers...
Each slide in the presenation has speaker's note attached - so you can download and learn
You can use it whenever you choose to do so.
Helping is appricited in any way (editing, fixing mistakes if you find any, adding extra knowledge, and off-course adding more such presenations on related topics)

Also, if you find it interesting, you can also buy the book. I have no interest in selling the book, I just think it is a good book.
